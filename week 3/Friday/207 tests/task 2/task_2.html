        <h1>We are going to the zoo</h1>
        <p>The Zoo is a delightful oasis designed specifically for young explorers.</p>
<br>
            <p>Filled with friendly, approachable animals, the zoo offers a fun and
            educational experience for kids of all ages. From the fluffy bunnies
            in the petting zoo to the playful otters swimming in their habitat,
            the Zoo encourages hands-on learning and sparks curiosity about the
            natural world.</p>
<br>
            <p>Interactive exhibits and engaging signage teach children about animal
            care, habitats, and conservation efforts. With safe, kid-sized walkways
            and plenty of shaded areas, the Zoo provides a safe, welcoming environment
            for families to discover the wonders of the animal kingdom.</p>
